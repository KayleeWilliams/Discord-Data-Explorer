# Discord Data Explorer

Discord Data Explorer provides users with an easy-to-use platform to visualise their data collected by Discord, built with [Nuxt.js 3](https://nuxt.com/blog/v3) and [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.2.x/).

## Installation
- Clone the repository.
- Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).
- Run `docker-compose up` in the root directory.

## Usage
- Navigate to `localhost:3000` in your browser.
- Upload your Discord Data Package (`.zip`) and wait for the data to be processed, which can take a few minutes, depending on your device.
